# Image Nodes

Atlas provides several nodes for generating or interpreting images.  
This section introduces the core nodes used for **text-to-image** generation and **image-to-text** extraction.

## Input Image Node

The **Input Image** node is used to upload images from your device into the Atlas workflow.  
Click the **upload icon** inside the node to select an image from your computer.  
Once uploaded, the image becomes an available input that you can connect to any node requiring image data.

Use this node whenever a workflow needs:
- a reference image  
- a concept art input  
- a render or screenshot  
- an asset to isolate or edit  
- an image required by Multimodal, Precise Text Edit, Camera Control, Remove Background, Image-to-Text, etc.

After uploading, simply drag a connector from the Output of the Input Image node to the Image Input port of the next node in your workflow.

## Fast Text-to-Image

The **Fast Text-to-Image** node generates images quickly based on a text prompt.  
It uses a lightweight backend optimized for **speed** rather than fidelity.

This node is ideal when you need:

- rapid ideation  
- quick thumbnails  
- early explorations of a concept  
- instant variations for iteration  

The output is less detailed and less accurate compared to the Quality Text-to-Image node, but significantly faster.

## Quality Text-to-Image

The **Quality Text-to-Image** node produces **high-fidelity, detailed images**.  
It uses **five different backends**, allowing you to choose different rendering styles and strengths.

### Key Features
- best visual quality among text-only generation nodes  
- multiple backends → diverse interpretations  
- good for environments, props, characters, concept art  
- consistent structure and lighting compared to faster models  

### Example: Quality vs Fast
Both nodes receive the same prompt.  
The Fast node generates a quick idea; the Quality node generates a polished version suitable for downstream workflows such as:

- Image-to-3D  
- Precise Text Edit  
- Marketing assets  
- Concept pipelines

## Image-to-Text {#image-to-text}

The **Image-to-Text** node converts images into structured or descriptive text.  
The system prompt controls what type of information is extracted.

### You can request:
- scene description  
- object list  
- spatial layout  
- material analysis  
- asset identification  
- style breakdown  
- inferred function or purpose

  <div style={{width:'70%'}}>
    ![](/img/node_introduction/image-nodes/imgtotext-image.png)
  </div>
</div>


### Example Use Cases
- Describe the objects in a rendered scene  
- Extract the composition of a top-down plan  
- Identify modular parts of a building  
- Produce a clean text prompt for concept art  
- Provide metadata for Make3D or Auto Mesh Transform

# Summary

| Node | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Fast Text-to-Image** | Quick idea generation | Text | Fast low-fidelity image |
| **Quality Text-to-Image** | High-quality renders | Text | Polished image (5 backends) |
| **Image-to-Text** | Scene, object, or layout analysis | Image | Descriptive or structured text |

These nodes form the **foundation** of Atlas' imaging pipeline—providing fast ideation, high-fidelity rendering, and precise scene understanding for all downstream workflows.
