  *Highly Detailed Assets Generated Using Atlas Platform*
</p>

While **Atlas Platform** aims to deliver high-quality assets with streamlined workflows, there are a few limitations and known behaviors to keep in mind:

### 🧾 Rendering & Compatibility Notes  

- **⏳ Texture Generation Time with ART Core**  
  Using **ART Core** to generate high-quality textures—especially at larger resolutions like **8K**—can take longer to process. Please allow extra time when requesting high-res textures.

- **🔍 Best Results in Blender**  
  PBR materials generated by the platform are optimized for viewing inside **Blender**. While `.glb` files work across multiple platforms, the most accurate representation of the materials—especially shaders and surface response—can be seen within Blender's rendering engine.

- **📐 Maximum Texture Size**  
  The current maximum supported texture resolution is **8K (8192x8192)**.


### ⚠️ Session Stability Notice

- During this Alpha phase, **long sessions** (especially with extended chat history) may cause occasional glitches in the agent's behavior.
- You can use the **"Wipe agents history"** feature to remove only the **chat interaction log with the AI agent**. This helps improve performance while preserving your assets and session state.

### 🛑 Fair Usage Policy  

- **Alpha Testing & Feedback**  
  The goal of this Alpha phase is to gather feedback and introduce users to the technology. **User activity and request volumes are monitored** to ensure fair access for all testers. If excessive or abusive use is detected, access to the platform may be restricted.

- **Running 3D AI Jobs Limit**  
  Each user is limited to **2 concurrent jobs** at a time. This restriction helps balance processing resources and maintain efficiency across all users.

We appreciate your participation in testing Atlas Platform and encourage you to share your insights to help shape its future!


We’re actively working on improvements and optimizations to reduce generation time and expand compatibility across platforms.
