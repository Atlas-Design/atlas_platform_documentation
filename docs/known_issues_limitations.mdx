  *Highly Detailed Assets Generated Using Atlas Platform*
</p>

While **Atlas Platform** aims to deliver high-quality assets with streamlined workflows, there are a few limitations and known behaviors to keep in mind:

- **⏳ Texture Generation Time with ART Core**  
  Using **ART Core** to generate high-quality textures—especially at larger resolutions like **8K**—can take longer to process. Please allow extra time when requesting high-res textures.

- **🔍 Best Results in Blender**  
  PBR materials generated by the platform are optimized for viewing inside **Blender**. While `.glb` files work across multiple platforms, the most accurate representation of the materials—especially shaders and surface response—can be seen within Blender's rendering engine.

- **📐 Maximum Texture Size**  
  The current maximum supported texture resolution is **8K (8192x8192)**.

We’re actively working on improvements and optimizations to reduce generation time and expand compatibility across platforms.
