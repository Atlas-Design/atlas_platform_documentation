## ðŸš€ Export and Integration

Once you're happy with the generated assets in **Atlas Platform**, you can easily export them for use in your game engine or DCC tools.

### ðŸ“¦ Export Formats

Currently, **Atlas Platform** supports the following export options:

- **`.blend` files**  
  Native Blender files that you can open and edit directly in the Blender DCC.

- **`.glb` files**  
  A universal format compatible with many game engines and 3D applications such as **Unreal Engine**.

### ðŸŽ® Using `.glb` Files in Unreal Engine

When importing `.glb` assets into **Unreal Engine**, it's important to pay special attention to **normal maps**. Unreal Engine uses **DirectX normal maps by default**, but it also **automatically flips the green (Y) channel** during import.

Hereâ€™s how to handle it correctly:

- If the normal map is named or marked as **DirectX**,  
  ðŸ‘‰ **Uncheck** the **"Flip Green Channel"** option in the texture settings after import.  
  This prevents double-flipping and ensures the normals render properly.

- If the normal map is in **OpenGL** format,  
  âœ… You can leave Unrealâ€™s default **"Flip Green Channel"** setting **enabled**.  
  The engine will flip it once, as expected.

> ðŸ”§ Tip: Always double-check the normal map preview after import to catch any unexpected shading artifacts.
