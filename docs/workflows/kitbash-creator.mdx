# Kitbash Creator Workflow

<div style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center', marginBottom:'20px'}}>

  <div style={{width:'95%'}}>
    ![](/img/asset_workflow/kitbash/workflownodes.png)
  </div>

</div>

Transform a complex scene into a full kitbash library of modular 3D assets.

This workflow extracts **every isolatable object** from a single image, generates **clean modular variants**, and reconstructs them as **individual GLB files** ready for 3D assembly.

---

## 1. Input a Scene Image

Provide a detailed image containing as many objects, structures, and elements as possible.  
The richer the scene, the stronger the resulting kitbash set.

<div style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center', marginBottom:'20px'}}>

  <div style={{width:'85%'}}>
    ![](/img/asset_workflow/kitbash/input.png)
  </div>

</div>

## 2. Image-to-Text — Extract a Kitbash Inventory

The Image-to-Text node generates a **numbered list** of every distinct visual element that could be turned into a reusable 3D module.

The system prompt instructs the node to:

- Identify **all modular components** (large + small)
- Avoid grouping elements together
- Focus on **shape** and **function**
- Ensure each item can be modeled as a **standalone asset**
- Output a clean, numbered list

<div style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center', marginBottom:'20px'}}>

  <div style={{width:'85%'}}>
    ![](/img/asset_workflow/kitbash/imagetotext.png)
  </div>

</div>

### Example Output

```
1. Steeply pitched timber-framed roof module with dormer windows.
2. Decorative wooden window frame with flower box.
3. Stone chimney with brick detailing.
4. Ornate hanging shop sign bracket.
5. Wooden door with iron hinges and handle.
6. Cobblestone street section with curved edge.
7. Stone foundation wall segment.
8. Wooden support beam with diagonal bracing.
9. Lantern-style street lamp on metal post.
10. Small wooden bench with slatted seat.
11. Triangular roof gable with exposed beams.
12. Multi-pane glass window with wooden mullions.
13. Brick wall section with arched window opening.
14. Flower pot with blooming plants.
15. Wooden barrel with metal bands.
16. Stone step module for building entrances.
17. Decorative roof finial or spire.
18. Hanging fabric banner with rope attachments.
19. Wooden signboard with painted lettering.
20. Iron wall-mounted lantern.
21. Small wooden crate.
22. Gutter and downspout assembly.
23. Stone archway for alley entrance.
24. Roof ridge tile segment.
25. Wooden balcony with railing.
```

## 3. Per-Item Isolation Prompts (Simple LLM Call)

For each numbered module (1 → 25), a Simple LLM Call converts the list entry into a **precise isolation prompt**.

The prompt tells the multimodal node to:

- Extract **only the specified module**
- Remove all surrounding context
- Place it on a **neutral background**
- Preserve correct proportions, silhouette, and materials
- Make it ready for 3D reconstruction

Each item becomes its own **extraction instruction**.

---

## 4. Multimodal Isolation — One Object at a Time

Each isolation prompt + original scene image goes into the Multimodal node.

Every backend produces **4 variant cutouts**, giving you:

- Slight stylistic differences  
- Different interpretations of occluded areas  
- Options for the cleanest geometry  

### Example Layout  

<div style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center', marginBottom:'20px'}}>

  <div style={{width:'85%'}}>
    ![](/img/asset_workflow/kitbash/2doutputs.jpg)
  </div>

</div>

Repeat this for every item (1 → 25).

At the end, you have a full sheet of modular 2D extractions.

---

## 5. Select the Best Variant for Each Object

From the 4 variants, pick the most structurally accurate version for each object.  
These will be used for 3D reconstruction.

---

## 6. Image-to-3D — Generate the Modular Models

Feed each chosen 2D isolation into the Image-to-3D node.

The node generates **one GLB per module**, producing a full modular kitbash set:

- Roof modules  
- Wall sections  
- Beams  
- Doors  
- Lamps  
- Windows  
- Chimneys  
- Decorative trims  
- Steps, crates, signage, props, etc.

You end up with 25+ uniquely modeled GLBs.

---

## 7. Auto Mesh Transform — Final Cleanup

Send each GLB through the **Auto Mesh Transform node** to:

- Normalize scale  
- Re-center origin points  
- Ensure consistent orientation  
- Make all assets “kitbash-ready”  

This step makes assembling scenes in Blender/Unreal much easier.

  </div>

## 8. Final Kitbash Library

You now have a **complete modular asset library** extracted from a single reference image.

<div style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center', marginBottom:'20px'}}>
