The **Concept Art Generator** workflow converts a full **Game Design Document (GDD)** into high-quality visual concept art.  
It reads the document, extracts its meaning, gathers reference images, and produces multiple concept-art variations ready for use in game development, worldbuilding, and mood-setting.

---

## 1. Input: Game Design Document (PDF)

Upload your complete GDD as a **PDF file**.

The workflow automatically extracts:

- **Text content** (lore, worldbuilding notes, mechanics, tone, etc.)  
- **Embedded images** (characters, props, environments, mood references)

Both channels are processed separately to maximize visual fidelity.

---

## 2. Phase 1 — Extract Text & Images

### Text Extraction
The **Text Extraction** node pulls all written content from the PDF.

This output becomes the foundation for generating a visual scene.

### Image Extraction
The **Image Extraction** node collects every embedded illustration, sketch, screenshot, or reference image.

These images will later guide the multimodal model toward the correct style, characters, and mood.

## 3. Phase 2 — Convert GDD Text Into a Concept Description

The extracted text is fed to a **Simple LLM Call**, which produces a refined, artist-ready description.

### Summary of the instruction:
- Read the GDD carefully  
- Convert the entire document into **one coherent concept-art scene**  
- Describe composition, atmosphere, lighting, palette, setting, characters, and style  
- Stay faithful to the GDD’s world logic  
- Output **one rich paragraph** suitable for text-to-image models  

This becomes the **master prompt** for generating the artwork.

  </div>
</div>

## 4. Phase 3 — Retrieve Additional Visual Inspiration

The extracted images from the PDF are passed into a **Retrieve Images** node.

### Summary of the instruction:
- Return images useful for **game world concept art**  
- Prefer visual cues for characters, architecture, landscapes, and cinematic lighting  

This curated reference batch enhances the final concept art.

---

## 5. Phase 4 — Multimodal Concept Art Generation

Two parallel flows now generate artwork:

### **Flow A — Multimodal with References**
Inputs:
- Retrieved reference images  
- The master concept prompt  

The **Multimodal node** produces **four variations per backend**, each influenced by the GDD’s extracted images.

This flow captures:
- Correct character designs  
- Architecture consistent with the document  
- Proper mood, lighting, and color  

---

### **Flow B — Quality Text-to-Image (No References Needed)**

If the GDD has **few or no images**, the master concept prompt is also passed directly to the **Quality Text-to-Image** node.

It produces **five high-quality frames per backend** with a more imaginative interpretation.

This ensures the workflow still works even if the PDF lacks visual material.

---

## 6. Phase 5 — Choose Your Final Concept Art

Both multimodal and quality text-to-image paths produce a gallery of concept art options.

You select:
- The most accurate  
- The most compelling  
- The version that best represents your game’s world and tone  

This becomes the official concept-art deliverable.

## Output
The workflow delivers finalized concept-art frames suitable for:

- Pre-production moodboards  
- Pitch decks  
- Game world direction  
- Character, environment, and architecture pipelines  

This ensures the entire worldbuilding foundation of your game is visually grounded from the first iteration.
