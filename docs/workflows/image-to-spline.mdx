# Image-to-Spline Workflow

This workflow converts an input (image or text description) into a clean spline curve usable in Blender or other 3D tools.  
There are three alternative methods:  

1) Image → Binary Mask → Spline  
2) Text → Image → Binary Mask → Spline (LLM-assisted)  
3) Text → Direct Binary Mask → Spline  

---

## Method 1 — Image to Binary Mask to Spline

### 1. Provide the Input Image

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/Italy-Political-Map.jpg)

Start by uploading an image whose outline you want to convert into a spline.  
Example: A map of Italy.

The Multimodal node is used to convert this image into a **binary mask** (black background, white foreground).  
It is essential that the **area you want to extract as a spline is white**.

---

### 2. Generate Binary Mask (Multimodal)

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/output_image.png)

The Multimodal node interprets the visual content and outputs a simplified mask:

- White = region to extract  
- Black = background  
- No textures, no colors, no gradients  

> The spline node works only if the white region corresponds to the target shape.

---

### 3. Convert Mask to Spline

Feed the binary mask into the **Image-to-Spline** node.

- It detects the **largest connected white region**  
- Converts the contour into a clean spline curve  
- Produces a downloadable spline file  

Import the resulting file into Blender to obtain the exact outline of the input map.

## Method 2 — Text to Image to Binary Mask (with LLM Assistance)

### 1. Describe the Shape You Want

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/image to spline.png)

You can generate a spline starting from a text prompt.  
Describe the object you want the spline for, such as:

> "Winding river that branches and creates islands."

A high-quality text-to-image node produces **4 variations**, each from a different backend.

Choose your favorite image to proceed.

---

### 2. LLM-Assisted Mask Composition

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/image to spline4.png)

Use a **Simple LLM Call** node to analyze your description.  
Its job is to extract the **main object** and produce an additional instruction:

Example extraction from the river prompt:

        "Main object: river network.
        Fill all visible river channels and branches (main stem and distributaries) with white; land areas and islands black."

This ensures the Multimodal node understands exactly **which regions should be white**.

---

### 3. Generate Binary Mask (Multimodal)

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/image to spline3.png)

Feed both the selected image and the LLM-generated mask instruction text into the Multimodal node.  
It outputs a binary mask that follows the intended foreground/background logic.

---

### 4. Convert to Spline

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/pasted-1762863069650-0.png)

Input the binary mask into the Image-to-Spline node.  
The node extracts the full river network as a white-connected region and returns a clean spline.

---

## Method 3 — Direct Binary Mask from Text

### 1. Describe the Target Shape

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/image to spline2.png)

In this method, the Multimodal node directly generates a **binary silhouette** from your text description.  
No intermediate photorealistic images are needed.

Example prompt:

> "Winding river with branching geometry and small islands."

---

### 2. Convert Binary Mask to Spline

![step-image](/img/asset_workflow/image-to-spline/pasted-1762862255995-0.png)

Select the best mask and feed it into the Image-to-Spline node.  
The node outputs the spline representation of the described shape.

## Summary of Methods

| Method | Input | Output Stages | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Image | Image → Binary Mask → Spline | When you already have a shape (map, silhouette, drawing) |
| 2 | Text | Text → Image → Mask (LLM-guided) → Spline | When you want creative variation with accurate foreground extraction |
| 3 | Text | Text → Direct Mask → Spline | Fastest method; good for abstract or simple shapes |

With these three options, you can extract spline contours from maps, objects, rivers, terrain shapes, or any described geometry—ready to import into Blender for further modeling.
