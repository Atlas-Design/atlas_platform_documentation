# Sketch-to-Asset Workflow

This workflow transforms a hand-drawn sketch into a fully usable 3D asset.
Starting from an imported sketch image, the pipeline generates concept renders and then 3D geometry that can be downloaded and used inside Blender or any other DCC tool.

---

## 1. Import Sketch

//![step-image]

Begin by importing a photo of your sketch.
This can be a quick phone picture or a refined illustration.
Optionally, you may add additional attributes such as:

- Color preferences  
- Material hints  
- Style notes (e.g., metallic, organic, wooden, mechanical)

> These optional text inputs help the AI produce more accurate concept variations.

---

## 2. Generate Concept Renders (Multimodal Node)

//![step-image]
The Multimodal node analyzes both the sketch image and the optional text hints.
It generates realistic concept renderings of your sketch.

- 4 different backends run in parallel  
- You receive 4 unique visual interpretations  
- Choose the one that best matches the target style or functionality

> This step helps refine the design direction before moving to full 3D generation.

---

## 3. Convert Concept to 3D

//![step-image]

After selecting your favorite concept render, feed it into the Image-to-3D node.

- 5 different backends create 5 versioned 3D models  
- Each backend provides a different modeling approach (stylized, realistic, lightweight, detailed, etc.)  
- Choose and download the 3D model you prefer  

All exported files are in `.glb` format, compatible with common 3D tools.

---

## 4. Import the Asset into Blender

//![step-image]

With your `.glb` ready, simply import it into Blender or your preferred software.

This allows you to:

- Edit geometry  
- Add materials and textures  
- Place it directly inside your scene or kitbash library  

> The final result becomes a fully reusable asset derived from your original sketch.
