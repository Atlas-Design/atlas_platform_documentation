# Concept Art → AssetKit

This workflow converts a single concept art image into a complete modular asset kit ready for 3D generation.

## 1. Input Concept Art

Upload any concept art containing multiple objects, props, or structures.

---

## 2. Extract 10 Assets (Multimodal)

The first Multimodal node isolates **10 distinct objects** from the concept art on a clean neutral background.  
Different backends generate different isolation layouts — choose the most accurate version.

---

## 3. Add Bounding Boxes (Multimodal)

The second Multimodal node adds **colored bounding boxes** to the selected isolation layout.  
Each of the 10 objects receives a unique color.  
This prepares the image for per-object extraction.

## 4. Extract Individual Assets (10× Multimodal)

Create 10 Multimodal nodes — one for each bounding box color.  
Each node extracts **only the object inside its assigned box**, removes the box itself, and outputs the object on a clean background suitable for 3D modeling.

### Example object outputs

## 5. Convert to 3D (Image → 3D)

Each isolated asset is passed to the Image-to-3D node.  
Every backend generates a different 3D interpretation.  
Pick the version that best matches the original object.

---

## 6. Auto Mesh Transform (Optional)

Use Auto Mesh Transform to standardize:
- scale  
- orientation  
- origin points  
- mesh cleanliness  

This prepares the final GLBs for Blender, Unreal, or Unity.

## Result

You now have a **10-piece AssetKit** extracted directly from concept art, complete with isolated 2D references, multiple 3D variants, and import-ready GLB files.
