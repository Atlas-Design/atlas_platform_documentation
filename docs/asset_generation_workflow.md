This section will walk you through the basic workflow of using [Atlas Platform](https://your-platform-url.com), from starting a session to exporting fully textured 3D game assets.

Atlas is not just a one-click generator — it’s a creative platform that guides you through a complete pipeline for game asset development, powered by AI and enhanced with our proprietary texturing system.

### 🗂️ 1. Create a New Session

Begin by creating a **session**. A session allows you to:
- Save your progress and data
- Return later to edit or continue asset creation
- Organize assets for a specific project or game

Sessions are essential for building full asset libraries over time.

### 💬 2. Generate Concept Images with the AI Agent

Once your session is active:
- **Chat with the AI agent** to describe the assets you need
- The agent will generate a set of **2D concept images** based on your description
- These are tailored suggestions for your game asset ideas

> The better your prompt, the more accurate and relevant the concept images will be.

### 🎨 3. Refine and Tweak the Images

If needed, you can:
- Continue chatting with the agent to **tweak or iterate** on the results
- Ask for style changes, shape variations, or additional ideas
- Select the images that best match your asset vision
- You can use style images that matches your needs to restyle the 2D images to match your style

### 🧱 4. Generate 3D Models from Selected Images

After selecting the desired 2D concepts:
- Generate **3D models** directly from those images
- Models will be created in a simplified form for preview and structure validation
- Using your own 2D images for assets is also possible 

### ✨ 5. Run ART Core for High-Quality Texturing

If you're satisfied with the mesh:
- Launch **ART Core**, our proprietary system for **ultra-detailed 3D texturing** (up to 8K resolution)
- This step may take some time, depending on asset complexity
- ART Core enhances the asset with production-quality materials and PBR-ready textures
- You can use style images to drive the style for the generated textures
- **Use the** `"low-poly PBR"` **keyword** to get an optimized low-poly game asset with baked PBR textures

> ART Core is a proprietary technology developed in-house and exclusive to Atlas Platform.

### 📦 6. Export Your Assets

Once your asset is finalized:
- **Download it** as a `.blend` file (for Blender)
- The `.glb` format is also available and it's recommended for Unreal Engine and other tools
- Assets include textures and are ready for integration into your game project

Now that you're familiar with the workflow, let’s move on to learning how to craft effective prompts and communicate clearly with the AI agent.
