  *Session Menu*
</p>

This helps you keep your work organized across different projects or creative directions.

- **01. Save project file**: Save your current setup, prompts, and generated assets.
- **02. Select other project**: Switch to a previously saved session to resume work.
- **03. Wipe agents history**: Clears only the **chat history with the AI agent** while keeping all generated assets and session data intact. This can help reset the conversation flow without losing your work.
- **04. Delete Project**:  Permanently removes the entire session, including all associated assets, prompts, and history. This action cannot be undone, so use it with caution when you no longer need the project.

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Assets Board*
</p>

This is the **Assets Board** of the **2D concept images** and **3D asset previews**. Each thumbnail represents an asset and comes with two action buttons:

- **01. Download**:  
  This button lets you download the asset, labeled clearly as either a `2D` or `3D` file. 

- **02. Add to Referal Asset Tray**:  
  This button places the selected asset into the **Referal Asset Tray**‚Äîa workspace where you can group, organize, or run operations on multiple selected assets. Think of it as a staging area for your generation pipeline.

### üí¨ Chat & Prompt Tools
![Platform Chat](/img/ui/chat.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Platform Chat*
</p>


The Chat & Prompt Tools allow you to communicate with the AI agent to generate concept images and refine asset ideas. You can describe what you need, ask for variations, and guide the creative direction using natural language ‚Äî making the process intuitive and interactive.

- **01. Prompt Suggestions Button**:  
  A toggle button that shows\hide the **AI-prompt ideas** section, providing users with suggested prompts to help generate assets more effectively.

- **02. Upload Asset Button**:  
  Upload your own 2D or 3D assets to integrate them into the current session.

- **03. Leave Feedback**  
  Opens a feedback window where you can share your experience, report bugs, or suggest improvements. Your input helps improve the platform during the Alpha phase.

- **04. Prompt Suggestion Button**  
   These prompts are **AI-generated suggestions** designed to inspire or assist your asset creation process. When you click on a suggestion, it will automatically populate the chat input field ‚Äî ready to be executed or edited before sending.

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Job Tracker*
</p>

The job tracker provides real-time visibility into all active processing tasks within your current session. Each category reflects a different stage of the asset generation pipeline:

- **01. 2D Jobs**  
  Displays the total number of currently running jobs for **2D image generation**. These are initiated when the AI agent generates concept art based on user prompts.

- **02. 3D Jobs**  
  Shows the total number of currently running jobs that convert **2D concept images into 3D models**. This stage involves the AI interpreting the selected image and generating a base mesh.

- **03. ART Jobs**  
  Represents the total number of currently running jobs within **ART Core (Atlas Refinement Tools)**. This stage is responsible for generating high-resolution textures and surface details.

- **04. PBR Jobs**  
  Indicates the total number of currently running jobs in **Atlas Asset Postprocessing**. This final step runs after ART Core and outputs an **optimized, game-ready asset** with low-poly geometry and baked PBR textures.
