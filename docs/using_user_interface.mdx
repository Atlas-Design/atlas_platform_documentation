The **Atlas Platform** user interface is designed to keep your creative flow intuitive and organized. Here's a quick overview of the main areas and how to use them:

---

### üîñ Session Menu
![Session Menu](/img/ui/session_menu.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Session Menu*
</p>

This helps you keep your work organized across different projects or creative directions.

- **01. Save project file**: Save your current setup, prompts, and generated assets.
- **02. Select other project**: Switch to a previously saved session to resume work.
- **03. Wipe agents history**: Clears only the **chat history with the AI agent** while keeping all generated assets and session data intact. This can help reset the conversation flow without losing your work.
- **04. Delete Project**:  Permanently removes the entire session, including all associated assets, prompts, and history. This action cannot be undone, so use it with caution when you no longer need the project.

### üñºÔ∏è Assets Board
![Assets Board](/img/ui/assets_board.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Assets Board*
</p>

This is the **Assets Board** of the **2D concept images** and **3D asset previews**. Each thumbnail represents an asset and comes with two action buttons:

- **01. Download**:  
  This button lets you download the asset, labeled clearly as either a `2D` or `3D` file. 

- **02. Add to Referal Asset Tray**:  
  This button places the selected asset into the **Referal Asset Tray**‚Äîa workspace where you can group, organize, or run operations on multiple selected assets. Think of it as a staging area for your generation pipeline.

### üí¨ Chat & Prompt Tools
![Platform Chat](/img/ui/chat.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Platform Chat*
</p>


The Chat & Prompt Tools allow you to communicate with the AI agent to generate concept images and refine asset ideas. You can describe what you need, ask for variations, and guide the creative direction using natural language ‚Äî making the process intuitive and interactive.

- **01. Prompt Suggestions Button**:  
  A toggle button that shows\hide the **AI-prompt ideas** section, providing users with suggested prompts to help generate assets more effectively.

- **02. Upload Asset Button**:  
  Upload your own 2D or 3D assets to integrate them into the current session.

- **03. Leave Feedback**  
  Opens a feedback window where you can share your experience, report bugs, or suggest improvements. Your input helps improve the platform during the Alpha phase.

- **04. Prompt Suggestion Button**  
   These prompts are **AI-generated suggestions** designed to inspire or assist your asset creation process. When you click on a suggestion, it will automatically populate the chat input field ‚Äî ready to be executed or edited before sending.

### üìä Job Tracker
![Job Tracker](/img/ui/job_tracker.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Job Tracker*
</p>

### üîÅ 01. Job Type (Pipeline Step)
The Job Tracker provides **real-time visibility** into all active processing tasks within your current session. Each category reflects a different stage of the asset generation pipeline and helps you monitor workload limits, job progress, and system availability.

- **2D**  
  **2D image generation** jobs. These are triggered when the AI agent generates concept art based on your prompts.

- **3D**  
  **2D images into 3D models** jobs . This stage uses AI to interpret the concept and build a base mesh.

- **ART Jobs**  
  **ART Core (Atlas Refinement Tools)** jobs . This stage applies high-resolution texturing and surface detail refinement.

- **PBR Jobs**  
  **Atlas Asset Postprocessing** jobs, the final pipeline step that delivers a **low-poly, game-ready asset** with baked PBR textures. This step begins after ART Core completes.


### üî¢ 02. Number of Jobs

Each job type may have a **limit on the number of parallel jobs** a user can run.

- When a job is started, the available job slot count is **decreased**.
- Once a job finishes, that slot becomes available again and the count **increases**.
- If the number reaches **zero**, you must wait for a current job to complete before submitting a new one of that type.

This mechanism ensures fair usage and efficient processing during the Alpha phase.


### üìà 03. Progress Bar

Each running job is represented by a **progress bar**, showing its estimated completion time.

- The bar gives a rough expectation of how long the task will take.
- Actual processing time may vary depending on the job‚Äôs complexity and system load.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: ART Core and PBR jobs may take longer, especially when generating high-resolution textures (4K or 8K).

### üñ±Ô∏è General Controls

This section covers the essential navigation and interaction controls for viewing and managing assets within the **Atlas Platform**. These shortcuts help you efficiently explore your generated 3D assets and navigate the viewer with ease.
- **Shift + Mouse Wheel**  
  Move the view **left and right** in the asset viewer.

- **Click on Thumbnail**  
  Clicking a thumbnail opens the corresponding **asset** in **full screen** for closer inspection.

### üß≠ 3D Viewer Controls
![3D Viewer](/img/ui/3d_viewer.jpg)

  *3D Viewer*
</p>

When previewing assets in the 3D viewer:

- **Left Click + Drag**  
  **Rotate** the camera around the asset.

- **Middle Mouse Button + Drag**  
  **Zoom in/out** to get a closer or wider view.

- **Right Click + Drag**  
  **Pan** the camera view to reposition your frame.
