This is the thumbnails of the **2D concept images** and **3D asset previews**. Each thumbnail represents an asset and comes with two action buttons:

- **01. Download**:  
  This button lets you download the asset, labeled clearly as either a `2D` or `3D` file. 

- **02. Add to Referal Asset Tray**:  
  This button places the selected asset into the **Referal Asset Tray**—a workspace where you can group, organize, or run operations on multiple selected assets. Think of it as a staging area for your generation pipeline.
