In the center of the interface, you’ll see the generated **2D concept images** and **3D asset previews**. Each thumbnail represents an asset and comes with two action buttons:

- **Add to Asset Tray**:  
  This button places the selected asset into the **Asset Tray**—a workspace where you can group, organize, or run operations on multiple selected assets. Think of it as a staging area for your generation pipeline.
