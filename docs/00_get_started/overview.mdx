# Platform Overview

The **Atlas Platform** is a visual AI workspace for creating, managing, and deploying generative workflows.
It combines a **Projects dashboard** for organization with a **Graph Editor** where users build node-based workflows that can be exported as APIs and used in external tools such as Unreal Engine.

Atlas is designed for both **artists** and **developers**:
- 🎨 **Artists & Technical Artists** can visually connect nodes, test outputs, and build reusable workflows.
- 🧩 **Developers & Integrators** can export workflows as APIs and integrate them into pipelines or custom tools.

---

## 🧭 Main Areas of the Platform

### **1. Projects**
The entry point of the platform.
From the **Projects** page, users can:
- View all existing projects with visual thumbnails.
- Create new workflows using the **New Project** button.
- Open existing projects to continue editing in the **Graph Editor**.
- Manage assets and access administrative tools (Users, Custom Pages, Platform Settings).

### **2. Graph Editor**
The core creative workspace.
Here, you build and connect nodes to form complex AI generation pipelines.

Each node represents a process — for example, “Text to Image,” “Image to 3D,” or “Post-Process.”
Nodes have embedded dropdowns for selecting compatible **backends**, defining how data is processed.

### **3. Nodes and Backends**
Nodes are modular units that define what happens in your workflow.
Each node:
- Has a specific role (image generation, mesh processing, API I/O, etc.).
- Can use different backends (e.g., `Atlas-GenMesh`, `Stable-Diffusion-XL`) via a dropdown selector.
- Stores backend version and parameters for deterministic, reproducible results.

---

### **4. API Export**
Once a workflow is ready, it can be **exported as an API**.
Each export includes:
- A unique **API ID**
- A set of **example payloads**
- Versioned backend information for consistent results

APIs can be consumed directly from supported tools (like Unreal Engine) or through HTTP requests.

## 🚀 Typical Workflow

1. **Start in Projects** → click **New Project** to create a workflow.
2. **Open the Graph Editor** → add and connect nodes.
3. **Select backends** per node to define output quality or performance.
4. **Test your workflow** inside the platform.
5. **Export it as an API** for integration with external tools.

---

## 🧠 Key Advantages
- **Visual-first**: No code required — everything is built through a node graph.
- **Cross-domain**: Works with text, images, meshes, and multimodal data.
- **Deterministic results**: Versioned backends ensure reproducibility.
- **Integration-ready**: Export APIs usable from Unreal, Python, or CLI.
