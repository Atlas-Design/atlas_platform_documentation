  *3D Assets Generated Using Atlas Platform‚Äôs High-Fidelity Pipeline*
</p>

This section will walk you through the basic workflow of using [Atlas Platform](https://your-platform-url.com), from starting a session to exporting fully textured 3D game assets.

Atlas is not just a one-click generator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a creative platform that guides you through a complete pipeline for game asset development, powered by AI and enhanced with our proprietary texturing system.

### üóÇÔ∏è 1. Create a New Session
![Create Session](/img/asset_workflow/create_session.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Create Session*
</p>

Begin by creating a **session**. A session allows you to:
- Save your progress and data
- Return later to edit or continue asset creation
- Organize assets for a specific project or game

Sessions are essential for building full asset libraries over time.

### üí¨ 2. Generate Concept Images with the AI Agent

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>

</p>


Once your session is active:
- **Chat with the AI agent** to describe the assets you need
- The agent will generate a set of **2D concept images** based on your description
- These are tailored suggestions for your game asset ideas

> The better your prompt, the more accurate and relevant the concept images will be.

#### üé® Refine and Tweak the Images

If needed, you can:
- Continue chatting with the agent to **tweak or iterate** on the results
- Ask for style changes, shape variations, or additional ideas
- Select the images that best match your asset vision
- You can use style images that matches your needs to restyle the 2D images to match your style

### üß± 3. Generate 3D Models from Selected Images

</p>

After selecting the desired 2D concepts:
- Generate **3D models** directly from those images
- Models will be created in a simplified form for preview and structure validation
- Using your own 2D images for assets is also possible 

### ‚ú® 4. Run ART Core for High-Quality Texturing

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>

</p>

> ART Core is a proprietary technology developed in-house and exclusive to Atlas Platform.

If you're satisfied with the mesh:
- Launch **ART Core**, our proprietary system for **ultra-detailed 3D texturing** (up to 8K resolution)
    > Example: *"Generate High Quality textures using ART core for the assets in the referal assets tray"*
- This step may take some time, depending on asset complexity
- ART core raw output is a mesh with only RGB and displacement maps (if dispalacement generated) so once the job is finished you can download the date and view the mesh details.
- You can use style images to drive the style for the generated textures
    > Example: *"Use the image in the referal assets tray as style image for ART core generation"*

    <p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>

    </p>

- Once you're happy with the textures from ART core you can **Use the** `"low-poly and PBR"` **keyword** to get an optimized low-poly game asset with baked PBR textures
    > Example: *"Generate low-poly with PBR materials for the assets in the referal assets tray"*

### üì¶ 5. Export Your Assets

Once your asset is finalized:
- **Download it** as a `.blend` file (for Blender)

- The `.glb` format is also available and it's recommended for Unreal Engine and other tools

- Assets include textures and are ready for integration into your game project
