  *3D Assets Generated Using Atlas Platform’s High-Fidelity Pipeline*
</p>

This section will walk you through the basic workflow of using [Atlas Platform](https://your-platform-url.com), from starting a session to exporting fully textured 3D game assets.

Atlas is not just a one-click generator — it’s a creative platform that guides you through a complete pipeline for game asset development, powered by AI and enhanced with our proprietary texturing system.

### 🗂️ 1. Create a New Session
![Create Session](/img/asset_workflow/create_session.jpg)
<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *Create Session*
</p>

Begin by creating a **session**. A session allows you to:
- Save your progress and data
- Return later to edit or continue asset creation
- Organize assets for a specific project or game

Sessions are essential for building full asset libraries over time.

### 💬 2. Generate Concept Images with the AI Agent
![2D concept art generation](/img/asset_workflow/2d_concept_art.jpg)

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *2D concept art generation*
</p>


Once your session is active:
- **Chat with the AI agent** to describe the assets you need
- The agent will generate a set of **2D concept images** based on your description
- These are tailored suggestions for your game asset ideas

> The better your prompt, the more accurate and relevant the concept images will be.

#### 🎨 Refine and Tweak the Images

If needed, you can:
- Continue chatting with the agent to **tweak or iterate** on the results
- Ask for style changes, shape variations, or additional ideas
- Select the images that best match your asset vision
- You can use style images that matches your needs to restyle the 2D images to match your style

### 🧱 3. Generate 3D Models from Selected Images

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>

</p>

After selecting the desired 2D concepts:
- Generate **3D models** directly from those images
- Models will be created in a simplified form for preview and structure validation
- Using your own 2D images for assets is also possible 

### ✨ 4. Run ART Core for High-Quality Texturing
![ART Core output](/img/asset_workflow/art_core_output.jpg)

<p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
  *ART Core output*
</p>

> ART Core is a proprietary technology developed in-house and exclusive to Atlas Platform.

If you're satisfied with the mesh:
- Launch **ART Core**, our proprietary system for **ultra-detailed 3D texturing** (up to 8K resolution)
    > Example: *"Generate High Quality textures using ART core for the assets in the referal assets tray"*
- This step may take some time, depending on asset complexity
- ART core raw output is a mesh with only RGB and displacement maps (if dispalacement generated) so once the job is finished you can download the date and view the mesh details.
- You can use style images to drive the style for the generated textures
    > Example: *"Use the image in the referal assets tray as style image for ART core generation"*
    ![Cyberpunk Style Image](/img/asset_workflow/cyberpunk_style.jpg)

    </p>
- These parameters configure how **ART core** system refines and/or restyles a 3D asset.Also, These parameters work together to control both the dimensional details (geometry, if displacement is used) and the texturing or style. By tuning them, you can achieve anything from subtle texture refinements to complete restyles of your 3D asset.

    - **input_mesh_filename** (string, required) 
      - Specifies which 3D file (.glb or .blend) the ART Core tool should process.
      - The system reads the geometry and existing textures (if any) in that file as the “base” for the enhancement or restyling.

    - **style_images_filenames** (list of strings, optional)
      - List of image file names (e.g., .png, .jpg) that will act as style references.
      - If provided, each image influences the final texturing or look of the 3D model, guided by the weights in style_images_weights.
      - Defaults to empty (no style image used) if not specified.

    - **style_images_weights** (list of floats, optional)
      - Specifies how strongly each style image in style_images_filenames influences the final texture.
      - Each value should be in the range [0, 1]. Typically 0.5 is a moderate influence; higher values inject a stronger style presence; lower values apply a subtler touch.

    - **generate_displacement_and_high_poly** (boolean, default: false)
      - If true, ART Core also generates and applies a displacement map, increasing the geometry complexity to produce a high-poly version of the mesh.
      - The result is both a refined texture and a more detailed geometry (with more vertices/triangles).
      - If false, ART Core only refines the textures, leaving the geometry unchanged.

    - **positive_prompt** (string, default: "")
      - A short descriptive prompt or keywords that guide the tool in shaping the final texture or style.
      - Max recommended length is ~15 words. E.g., “wooden, steampunk, worn” or “ancient stone, runes, cracked.”

    - **negative_prompt** (string, default: "")
      - A short descriptive prompt or keywords the tool tries to avoid.
      - E.g., “cartoon, glossy, neon” (if you do not want an overly bright and glossy look).

    - **resolution** (string, default: "2k")
      - The resolution of the refined textures. Possible values are "2k", "4k", or "8k."
      - Higher resolutions produce sharper detail but require more processing time and hardware resources.

    - **existing_texture_preservation** (float, default: 0)
      - A value in the range [0, 1] controlling how much the system preserves the original mesh’s texture.
      - 0 means “generate from scratch” (disregard the original), while 1 means “preserve almost all details of the original texture” and minimally alter them.
      - Values close to 0.5 can blend old and new textures if you want partial style or color changes while still referencing the original.

    - **unshade_strength** (float, default: 0.5)
      - A value [0,1] determining how aggressively to remove baked-in shadows, highlights, or ambient occlusion from the original texture.
      - 0 means “don’t remove any shading,” 1 means “try to remove all shading, leaving mostly diffuse color.”

- Once you're happy with the textures you can run **APS (Asset Presentation Stage)** which runs after ART core to deliver an optimized low-poly game asset with baked textures. you can **Use the** `"low-poly and PBR"` **keyword**. Once a job is run you can see it at the job tracker **APS Jobs**
    > Example: *"Generate low-poly with PBR materials for the assets in the referal assets tray"*

### 📦 5. Export Your Assets

Once your asset is finalized:
- **Download it** as a `.blend` file (for Blender)
![Assets rendered in Blender](/img/asset_workflow/art_core_output.jpg)

  <p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
    *Assets rendered in Blender*
  </p>

- The `.glb` format is also available and it's recommended for Unreal Engine and other tools
![.glb file asset in Unreal Engine 5](/img/asset_workflow/export_unrealengine.jpg)

  <p align="left" style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
    *.glb file asset in Unreal Engine 5*
  </p>

- Assets include textures and are ready for integration into your game project
