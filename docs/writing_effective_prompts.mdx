   3D Assets Generated Using Atlas Platformâ€™s High-Fidelity Pipeline
  </p>

Prompts play a central role in the creative workflow within **Atlas Platform**. They guide the AI agent in generating both **2D concept images** and outputs through **Art Core** that align with your game's style, theme, and overall vision.

Whether you're building an environment, a set of props, or a full character lineup, writing clear and intentional prompts helps you produce consistent and high-quality asset concepts that work together as part of a cohesive game world.

### ðŸ§  How Prompts Work

Prompts act as creative instructions for the AI agent. You describe what you need, and the AI generates visual suggestions for assets that match your description. These 2D concepts form the base for 3D model generation.

You can:
- Describe **entire asset categories** (e.g., forest environment elements, sci-fi weapons)
- Specify **style direction** (e.g., realistic, stylized, hand-painted)
- Reference **game genre** or lore (e.g., survival horror, Egyptian mythology, post-apocalyptic)

### âœ… Prompt Writing Tips

Here are some best practices for writing effective prompts:

- **Be specific, but not overly detailed**  
  > Good: *"Ancient ruins props with mossy stones and broken pillars in a realistic style"*  
  > Avoid: *"Some kind of objects for a game"*

- **Group related assets in one prompt**  
  > Example: *"A set of magical potions in glass bottles with glowing liquid, fantasy style"*

- **Use style references**  
  If you want consistency, refer to known styles (e.g., *"Studio Ghibli style trees"*, *"Borderlands-style weapons"*), or upload a style image for visual guidance.

- **Add texture or material cues** to guide surface details  
  > Example: `"hand-painted textures"`, `"worn metal"`, `"leather and wood"`

- **Use color guidance** if needed  
  > Example: `"vivid colors with strong contrasts"` or `"muted, earthy tones"`

- **Refer to known games or styles** for consistent results  
  > Example: `"in the style of *The Witcher*"` or `"similar to *Warcraft*"`

- **Use the** `ART core` **keyword** to use ART core for texturing the 3D meshes
  > Example: `"Generate high Quality textures using ART core for this 3D model"`

- **Use the** `"Preserve Texture"` **keyword** to maintain a consistent textures style

- **Use the** `"low-poly PBR"` **keyword** to get an optimized low-poly game asset with baked PBR textures

### ðŸŽ¯ Maintaining Visual Consistency

When creating **sets of assets**, itâ€™s important to:

- Stick to a consistent **style**, **color palette**, and **tone**
- Use similar phrasing or prompts across sessions

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: If you're working across multiple sessions, copy over successful prompts or load a saved session to stay consistent.

### ðŸ“Œ Example Prompts

- *"5 stylized fantasy props in the style of *Warcraft*, featuring hand-painted textures, a sculpted feel, and vivid colors with strong contrasts"*
- *"7 detailed medieval props in the style of *The Witcher*, with realistic textures, muted tones, and a grounded, gritty aesthetic"*
- *"10 futuristic props in a **cyberpunk** style, featuring sleek designs, neon accents, worn metallic textures, and a high-tech, gritty atmosphere"*
